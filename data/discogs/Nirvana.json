  "profile" : "Rock band from Aberdeen, Washington, USA, formed in 1987. Emerging from the Seattle grunge scene of the late 1980s/early 1990s, Nirvana was a power trio of musicians who brought a new aesthetic to the rock scene of the time. They had already released their debut LP \"[m=13773]\" with Sub Pop, but their 1991 major-label debut for [l=DGC]/[l=Geffen Records], \"[m=13814]\" broke the band and grunge into the mainstream of America.
